# Harry-Potter-Sorting-hat
Ever wondered if you can sort out your friends or colleagues in houses just like in harry potter!?

This python code just does that. 
The "sorting-cap.py" needs to be run each time unless everybody is assigned with a house.

Example o/p: "Pikachu goes to  slytherin house."

The "sorting-cap-at-once.py" needs to be run only once and it will assign random houses to people in order.

Example o/p: 

 "Monica goes to gryffindor house.
Chandler goes to hufflepuff house.
Phoebe goes to ravenclaw house.
Rachael goes to ravenclaw house.
Joey goes to ravenclaw house.
Ross goes to hufflepuff house.
Pikachu goes to hufflepuff house.
Sheldon goes to slytherin house.
Michael goes to ravenclaw house.
Dwight goes to ravenclaw house.
Toby goes to hufflepuff house.
Holly goes to slytherin house."
